  <p>
    Treatment for stage 4 melanoma is given in the hope that it can slow the cancer's growth, reduce symptoms, and extend life expectancy.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may be offered surgery to remove other melanomas that have grown away from the original site.
    You may also be able to have other treatments to help with your symptoms, such as <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/radiotherapy/" target="blank">radiotherapy</a> and medicine.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you face advanced melanoma, you may decide not to give treatment if it's unlikely to significantly extend your patient expectancy,
    or if your patient do not have symptoms that cause pain or discomfort.
  </p>

  <p>
    If your patient decide not to receive treatment, pain relief and nursing care will be made available when he/she needs it.
    This is called <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/end-of-life-care/what-it-involves-and-when-it-starts/" target="blank">palliative care</a>.
