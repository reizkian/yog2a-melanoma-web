  <p>Excision, with or without lymph nodes management.</p>

  <p>
    Treating stage 1 melanoma involves surgery to remove the melanoma and a small area of skin around it.
    This is known as surgical excision.
  </p>

  <p>
    Surgical excision is usually done using <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/local-anaesthesia/" target="blank">local anaesthetic</a>, which means you'll be awake, but the area around the melanoma will be numbed, so you will not feel pain.
    In some cases, <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/general-anaesthesia/" target="blank">general anaesthetic is used</a>, which means you'll be unconscious during the procedure.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a surgical excision is likely to leave a significant scar, it may be done in combination with a <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/plastic-surgery/what-happens/#skin-grafts" target="blank">skin graft</a>.
    However, skin flaps are now more commonly used because the scars are usually less noticeable than those resulting from a skin graft.
  </p>

  <p>A <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/melanoma-skin-cancer/diagnosis/#further-tests" target="blank">sentinel lymph node biopsy</a> is a procedure to test for the spread of cancer. It's done at the same time as surgical excision.</p>

  <p>If you decide to have the procedure and the results show no spread to nearby lymph nodes, it's unlikely you'll have further problems with this melanoma.</p>

  <p>If the results confirm melanoma has spread to nearby nodes, you will discuss with your patient further surgery is required.</p>

  <p>Additional surgery involves removing the remaining nodes, which is known as a lymph node dissection or completion lymphadenectomy.</p>
