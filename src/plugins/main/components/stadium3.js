  <p>Excision, with or without lymph nodes management; adjuvant therapy and immunotherapy.</p>

  <p>
    Multiple options for adjuvant treatment of node-positive melanoma have become available.
    A critical question for guiding the choice of regimens is whether the tumor contains a BRAF V600 mutation.
  </p>

  <p>
    In patients with no BRAF mutation (ie, wild-type BRAF),
    current guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
    recommend single-agent immunotherapy with the programmed cell deathâ€“1 (PD-1)
    inhibitor pembrolizumab or nivolumab or combination therapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab.
  </p>

  <p>
    For patients with a BRAF mutation, the NCCN recommends targeted combination therapy with dabrafenib/trametinib or vemurafenib/cobimetinib.
    Targeted therapy is preferred if clinically needed for early response. Current targeted therapies can slow tumor growth (eg, BRAF inhibition) or
    release the brakes on the immune response, resulting in tumor lysis (eg, PD-1 inhibition).
